BeTFSM is a library for "ticking" statemachines and behavior trees. In this unified framework, discrete tasks can be specified with the modularity of
behavior trees and at the lower-level precise interaction can be specified using state machines. It targets discrete coordination of robotic systems at
both high- and low level.

## Generate most recent documentation (for developers)

Documentation provided in mkdocs, with the library build and installed, you
can access documentation by:

```
cd ./documentation
./browse
```
This will generate a python environment to run mkdocs with the appropriate libraries.
In order for the python documentation to be generated, the libraries have to be installed and build.


You can build the documentation into a directory `./site' using:
```
cd ./documentation
venv/bin/mkdocs build
```
